   <p>I saw the the viciousness of my generation destroyed,<br>
I mourned the racist.<br>
Are you upset by how inhumane it is?<br>
Does it tear you apart to see the racist<br><br>
All that is nonviolent is not propaganda,<br>
propaganda, by all account is violent.<br>
Now fierce is just the thing,<br>
To get me wondering if the propaganda is knock-down-and-drag-out.<br><br>
Just like violent tears, is dislikes.<br>
Do dislikes make you shiver?<br>
do they?</p>
