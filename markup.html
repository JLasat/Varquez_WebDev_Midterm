   <p>I saw the the viciousness of my generation destroyed,<br>
I <em>mourned</em> the racist.<br>
Are you upset by how <strong>inhumane</strong> it is?<br>
Does it tear you apart to see the racist<br><br>
All that is nonviolent is not propaganda,<br>
propaganda, by all account is violent.<br>
Now fierce is just the thing,<br>
To get me wondering if the propaganda is knock-down-and-drag-out.<br><br>
Just like <strong>violent tears</strong>, is dislikes.<br>
Do dislikes make you <em>shiver</em>?<br>
do they?</p>
